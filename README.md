## Analysis Points
  ### Probability Level:
  Assessed the likelihood of rainfall by classifying it into probability levels. Used statistical thresholds to define binary classes,      enabling the model to predict the probability of high or low rainfall effectively. The classification helps simplify predictions and      interpret results.
  ### Analysis of Rainfall Level:
  Conducted detailed analysis of rainfall distribution, identifying patterns and trends. Visualizations, such as histograms and scatter     plots, highlighted seasonal or regional rainfall patterns. The rainfall median was used to divide levels, allowing models to predict if   rainfall would be above or below average.
  ### Analysis with SVM Accuracy:
  Trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a linear kernel to classify rainfall levels. Through hyperparameter tuning and          standardized data inputs, achieved a balanced accuracy level. SVMâ€™s margin-based classification proved useful for distinguishing          between classes, and performance was assessed using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
  ### Analysis with Decision Tree Classifier:
  Built a Decision Tree Classifier for rainfall prediction, allowing the model to make decisions based on feature thresholds. The tree      structure provided interpretability, showing decision paths based on feature importance. Evaluation metrics showed good performance,      though it was susceptible to overfitting without pruning.
  ### Analysis with Random Forest Classifier:
  Utilized a Random Forest Classifier, which aggregated multiple decision trees for a more robust and generalized model. This approach
  reduced overfitting and improved accuracy. The model was tuned for the number of trees and depth, yielding high accuracy, precision,      and F1-scores.
  ### Analysis with Logistic Regression:
  Applied Logistic Regression as a baseline model to assess its effectiveness in predicting binary rainfall levels. The model provided      probability scores, offering insights into confidence levels for each prediction. Although Logistic Regression performed slightly lower   in complex patterns, it delivered high interpretability and served as a strong baseline.
These analyses provided a comprehensive understanding of each model's performance, enabling selection of the best model based on          accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. Each model's strengths were leveraged, ensuring an effective approach to predicting           rainfall levels.
